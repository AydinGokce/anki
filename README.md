# Aydin's Anki Decks
I have set up my anki workflow as follows. I take notes in my logseq graph database. Using the logseq AnkiConnect plugin, it is trivial to autogenerate anki flashcards from my notes. After I've finished a study session and have synced my logseq notes to anki, I export them to JSON using the CrowdAnki plugin, then I push them to github.

This allows me to generate anki cards from my notes with basically no work, collaborate with others on building decks, and sync my cards across machines.
